// ============================================================
// PROJECTS.js — Project photo gallery data
// ============================================================
// Separate from CONFIG.js on purpose: this file updates far more
// often (new completed jobs) than the rest of the site config, and
// is written automatically by the Houzflow asset pipeline's publish
// step once that's live. Keeping it isolated means a malformed write
// here can never break the rest of the site (header, services, etc).
//
// Format is a plain global array — intentionally NOT nested in an
// object — so the publish step can write this whole file with simple
// string templating (assign the JSON-stringified array to a single
// top-level array variable). No AST-aware JS writer or bundler
// required on the Worker side.
//
// Field notes:
//   alt          — descriptive alt text (from the pipeline's alt_text
//                  field). Never reuse `title` here — title is a project
//                  label, alt should describe what's actually in the photo.
//   width/height — explicit intrinsic dimensions (post-Photon-resize),
//                  prevents layout shift (CLS) while the image loads.
//   featured     — true = eligible to show in the home page "Recent Work"
//                  section (capped at 8–9 there). Lets curation/approval
//                  decide what's a homepage-worthy shot vs. just-the-gallery.
//   publishedAt  — optional, supports freshness sorting later.
